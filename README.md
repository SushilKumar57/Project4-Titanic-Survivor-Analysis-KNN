FamilySize in the ship does not have much correlance with survival rate.


If the person is alone he/She has less chance of surviving.


>  The reason might be the person who is travelling withh is family might be belonging to rich class and might be prioritized over other.


So we can see if the person was not alone, the chance of the ticket price is high.

*   Female passengers were prioritized over men.

*   People with high classs or rich people have higher survival rate than others. 

*  The hierarichy might have been followed while saving the passengers.
